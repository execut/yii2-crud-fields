# Yii2 CRUD fields
This component allows you to automate many processes that occur in working with models, thereby reducing code
duplication, and hence the total time spent:
* Writing validation rules for fields of the same type
* Writing Getters to Declare Various Relationships with Other Models
* Validating and Editing Linked Records
* Setting up the edit form for the model and its associated records
* Customizing the Model Record List
* Translating field names
* Adds the ability to extend models by a third-party module without adding new dependencies
* Simplifies the process of unit testing models
